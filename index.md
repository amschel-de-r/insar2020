### Bayesian Optimisation

What is bayesian optimisation?

### How do we use BO?

In GNG (and SA) task, speed affects how well we capture inhibition
| Example of too fast | Example of too slow | Example of just right |
Add graphs from sample data

But this optimum speed will be different for different people - how do we find it quickly?

By using a warm-up task that serves to familiarise with tablet, we can test how well an individual can click items moving across screen at variable speeds
If we code speed and hit-rate together as one variable, we can optimise to find the fastest speed that an individual can still react to

Example of BO with graph annotated?

Want to have a go for yourself? Try out below
N.B. optimisation still undergoing fine-tuning, and may as of yet not adapt perfectly to all individuals. Speed range may also not contain optimal speed for all individuals

(For now, game as is)
(Game, for 50 trials, at end shows optimised speed in mini-camera with button to replay, or play GNG at this speed. At end of GNG, show hit rate and error rate)
